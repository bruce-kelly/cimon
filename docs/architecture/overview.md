# Architecture Overview

CIMON is a Bubbletea TUI for monitoring GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines across multiple repos. Config-driven via `.cimon.yml`. Tokyo Night theme. Written in Go.

## Data Flow

```
.cimon.yml → CimonConfig → github.Client → Poller → PollResult → App → Screens → Components
```

1. **Startup.** `main.go` loads config via `config.Load()` (CWD walk-up), discovers GitHub token, opens SQLite DB, then passes all three to `app.NewApp()`. The App creates `polling.Poller`, builds config-derived lookups (release/agent workflow maps), and initializes screen models. The `internal/app` package is separate from `internal/ui` to avoid circular imports (screens import `ui` for theme).

2. **Poll cycle.** `Poller` runs in a goroutine, polls each repo, sends `PollResult` over a channel. A `tea.Cmd` reads from the channel and delivers it as a message to the Bubbletea update loop. Adaptive cadence: idle (30s) when nothing running, active (5s) when in-progress, cooldown (N idle ticks) before dropping back.

3. **Data distribution.** App's `Update()` receives `PollResultMsg`, persists runs/jobs/PRs to SQLite, builds review items and agent profiles, syncs agent status, evaluates auto-fix triggers, checks catch-up state. Routes data to the active screen model.

4. **Screen rendering.** Each screen model has a `Render()` method that returns a string. Components compose lipgloss-styled strings. The `Selector` pattern provides j/k navigation for list views.

5. **Actions.** User keybinding → confirm bar (if destructive) → action handler → GitHub API → flash result.

## Screen Architecture

- **Dashboard (`1`):** Three panels — review queue, active pipelines (per-repo), agent roster. Home screen.
- **Timeline (`2`):** Unified chronological feed across all repos. Color-coded by repo.
- **Release (`3`):** Per-repo release pipeline with job status, confidence scoring. Left/right to switch repos.
- **Metrics (`4`):** Historical CI health and agent task statistics from SQLite, per-repo.
- **Log Pane (`l`):** Toggleable from any screen. `l` cycles through closed/open/fullscreen. Diff highlighting for PR diffs. LIVE streaming for agent output.
- **Catch-up:** Overlay after idle > threshold summarizing CI/agent/PR changes while away.
- **Filter (`/`):** Case-insensitive multi-term filter across all list components. `Esc` clears.
- **Help (`?`):** Context-sensitive overlay showing available keybindings for current screen.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Bubbletea v2 Elm architecture.** Pure functional Model-Update-View. `View()` returns `tea.View` with `AltScreen = true`. No direct p.Send() — all communication via channels and tea.Cmd.
- **Pure Go SQLite.** `modernc.org/sqlite` (no CGO) enables cross-compilation. Dual writer/reader connections with WAL mode.
- **Multi-repo from the data layer up.** Config, client, models all support multiple repos. Views aggregate.
- **Process group isolation.** Agent subprocesses use `Setpgid: true` so entire process trees can be killed cleanly.
- **Backward-compatible config.** v1 `repo` key auto-migrates to v2 `repos` list.
- **ETag caching.** Bounded LRU cache (5000 entries, `container/list` + `sync.Mutex`). Conditional requests reduce API usage.
- **GoReleaser distribution.** Single binary for 6 platform targets. Homebrew tap for macOS.
